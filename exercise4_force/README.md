1- Execute the script setup_demo.m

2- Run modulated_ds_interface.m

   Usage: 1: modulated_ds_interface
          2: modulated_ds_interface(generatePerturbation, makeAMovie, loadSavedSurfaceModel)
          generatePerturbation: (Boolean) Generate a perturbation on the robot during the
                                          simulation. Default = false.
