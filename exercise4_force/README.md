## exercise4_force
An approach for modulating a dynamical system (DS) for contact force generation along a surface [1].

### Installing the exercise
Run the script ```setup_demo.m```

**Compatibility**: These exercise scripts have been tested in Matlab versions 2015a - 2018a.

### Running the gui for exercise sessions
- ```modulated_ds_interface.m```: Brings up a GUI for the simulation of force generation with dynamical systems as proposed in [1]. With this GUI you can learn a model of a surface and simulate the task of generating a desired contact force along the surface.

*A guided video explaining how to use the GUI, can be found in this [link](https://youtu.be/jDcPaOUMwvI)*

- ```modulated_ds_interface(1,0,1).m```: Brings up a GUI that loads a pre-learned surface model and applies a single continuous perturbation during the execution of the task [1].
